    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions apply to the <strong>Unlim AI: Truly Unlimited GPT</strong> app (hereby referred to as “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by <strong>ZenX Apps</strong> (“Service Provider”) as a Free service.
    </p>

    <p>
      By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully before use. Unauthorized copying, modification, or extraction of the Application’s source code, trademarks, or design is strictly prohibited. All intellectual property rights remain the property of the Service Provider.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider strives to make the Application as useful and efficient as possible. They reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for certain services at any time. Any charges will be clearly communicated in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Application stores and processes personal data provided by you to deliver its services. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as it may compromise security, expose it to malware, or prevent the Application from functioning correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. You can review them below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Connectivity and Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Service Provider is not responsible for any limited functionality due to network unavailability or data exhaustion. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, you may incur data charges as per your mobile network provider’s agreement. You are responsible for these charges, including roaming fees. If you are not the bill payer for the device, it is assumed you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
    </p>

    <h2>Device Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for keeping your device charged. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application fails to function due to low battery or hardware issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Updates</h2>
    <p>
      While the Service Provider endeavors to keep the Application accurate and up to date, they rely on third-party data sources and cannot guarantee complete reliability. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss resulting from the use of the Application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Updates may be required from time to time to continue using the Application. You agree to install such updates when offered. The Service Provider may discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may update these Terms periodically. Updates will be posted on this page, and continued use of the Application signifies acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or suggestions about these Terms and Conditions, contact the Service Provider at
